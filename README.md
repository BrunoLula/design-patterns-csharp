C# Design Patterns – Practical Examples
📌 Overview

This repository contains practical and concise implementations of 10 essential Design Patterns using C#.

Each pattern is implemented as a small, focused project, demonstrating:

Clear intent

Real-world use cases

Clean and readable code

Separation of concerns

The goal of this repository is to serve as a learning resource, reference, and portfolio showcase for software engineers working with .NET.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Understand when and why to use each Design Pattern

Apply SOLID principles in practice

Improve architectural thinking

Provide clean, interview-ready examples

Serve as a long-term reference for real projects

🧩 Implemented Design Patterns
#	Pattern	Category	Description
01	Singleton	Creational	Ensure a single instance with global access

02	Factory Method	Creational	Delegate object creation to subclasses

03	Builder	Creational	Build complex objects step by step

04	Strategy	Behavioral	Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors

05	Observer	Behavioral	Notify dependents of state changes

06	Decorator	Structural	Add behavior dynamically without inheritance

07	Command	Behavioral	Encapsulate requests as objects

08	Adapter	Structural	Make incompatible interfaces work together

09	Facade	Structural	Simplify access to complex subsystems

10	Repository	Structural / DDD	Abstract data access logic

Each folder contains:

A small C# project

A dedicated README.md

A clear and focused implementation of the pattern

🧠 Design Principles Applied

Throughout the projects, the following principles are consistently applied:

SOLID Principles

Separation of Concerns

Clean Code

Dependency Inversion

Low Coupling / High Cohesion

▶️ How to Run the Examples

Open the desired project folder

Run the project using:

dotnet run


Observe the console output to understand the behavior

All examples are console-based for simplicity and clarity.
